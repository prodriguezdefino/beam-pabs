# Rust SDK

A library for writing [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) pipelines in Rust.

The SDK is under active development. [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) describes its design.

## Crate Layout

The SDK is a Cargo workspace with its root at `sdks/rust`:

| Crate | Path | Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `apache-beam-model` | `beam/model/` | Protobuf and gRPC bindings generated from the standard Beam model protos. |
| `apache-beam-derive` | `beam/derive/` | `#[derive(BeamRow)]` and `#[derive(BeamEnum)]` proc-macros. Re-exported through `apache-beam-core`; not depended on directly. |

## Building and Testing

Run builds through Gradle, like the rest of the Beam repository:

```bash
./gradlew :sdks:rust:build   # Compile all crates
./gradlew :sdks:rust:test    # Run all tests (one crate: -Ppkg=<crate>)
./gradlew :sdks:rust:check   # rustfmt --check + clippy -D warnings
./gradlew :sdks:rust:fmt     # Apply formatting
```

For the full task reference, see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Contributing

See the [Beam Contribution Guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/). Each new file must have the standard Apache 2.0 license header. Before you open a PR, run `./gradlew :sdks:rust:check` to verify compliance.
